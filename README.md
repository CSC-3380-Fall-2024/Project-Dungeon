# Project Dungeon
## Extensions used:
- Git Bash: This is how we add, commit, and push changes or projects
     
- Visual Studio Code: This is what I use if I want to edit the scripts from the File Explorer.
    
- Visual Studio 2022: This is what Unity pulls up if you ever double click a script in the project window.
