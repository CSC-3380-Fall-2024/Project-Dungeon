# Project Dungeon
1.) Extensions used:
   -  Git Bash: This is how we add, commit, and push changes or projects
     
    - Visual Studio Code: This is what I use if I want to edit the scripts from the File Explorer.
    
    - Visual Studio 2022: This is what Unity pulls up if you ever double click a script in the project window.
    
   -  Note: Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio 2022 both work. Our group differs on what we use
